This repository contains computer graphics program that i am studying in my B.tech porgram.
This repository contains a collection of basic and advanced Computer Graphics (CG) programs implemented using C/C++ with graphics libraries (like OpenGL/GLUT or Turbo C++ graphics.h), and Python with PyOpenGL.

Topics Covered
✅ Basic 2D Shapes (Line, Circle, Polygon Drawing)

✅ Bresenham’s Line and Circle Algorithms

✅ DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)

✅ 2D Transformations (Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Reflection)

✅ Composite Transformations

✅ 3D Transformations (basic)

✅ Line Clipping (Cohen-Sutherland, Liang-Barsky)

✅ Polygon Filling (Flood Fill, Boundary Fill, Scan-line)

✅ OpenGL Programs (interactive rendering)

 Technologies Used
C / C++ (graphics.h, GLUT)

Python (PyOpenGL, Pygame)

OpenGL for 2D/3D rendering
